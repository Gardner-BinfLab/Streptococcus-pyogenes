### Classification of *Streptococcus pyogenes* strains by disease phenotypes and pathogenicity
1. Create a profile HMM database specific to *S. pyogenes*. See ```README.md``` in ```doc/```
2. Compare profile HMM models using AUC scores. Create random forest classifiers using the top 10 models, where each classifier was built by labelling a disease phenotype as 1 and others as 0 at a time. See ```README.md``` in ```Jupyter/```
